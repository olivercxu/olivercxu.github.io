<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to my page! I am Chao (Oliver) Xu. Currently, I work at Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, as a research assistant, affiliated with [the Advanced Biomedical Imaging Laboratory](https://www.bme.cuhk.edu.hk/yuan/index.html).    

During my postgraduate period, I mainly focused on minimally invasive high-resolution endoscopic [optical coherence tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography) (OCT) and its preclinical applications. Currently, I am working on the high-resolution intravascular OCT for clinical use. I am also developing some advanced fabrication technology for high-performance OCT endoscopy. 

I graduated from College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University with a bachelor’s degree and from Daheng College, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences with a Master's degree. I further obtained my doctor's degree from Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. [Wu (Scott) Yuan (袁武)](https://www.bme.cuhk.edu.hk/yuan/people.html).

My research interest includes high-resolution OCT, optical endomicroscopy, and preclinical /clinical applications related with OCT. I have published 17 papers at the top international journals such as Nature Communications, APL Photonics, and Communications Engineering.
